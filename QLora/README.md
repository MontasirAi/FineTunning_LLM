# Gemma 2 for Moroccan Darija
Darija combines elements from Arabic, Berber, French, and Spanish, making it distinct from Modern Standard Arabic (MSA).
As the primary language for informal communication, it is widely used in daily life, media, and social interactions.
This project aims to fine-tune Gemma 2 specifically for tasks involving Moroccan Darija,
addressing its unique linguistic characteristics and regional variations.
